# [PROJECT NAME] Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: [DATE]

## Active Technologies

[EXTRACTED FROM ALL PLAN.MD FILES]

## Project Structure

```text
[ACTUAL STRUCTURE FROM PLANS]
```

## Constitution Reference

This file and any auto-generated guidance MUST reference the Galeria Constitution.
When an agent or script produces a plan/spec/tasks/checklist it must include a
"Constitution Compliance" block summarizing how the generated content meets the
principles: Clean Code, Performance, UX, Tests & Contracts, and Observability.

Automated checks in CI should verify the presence of this block for feature
plans and specs; absence should fail the generation pipeline.
